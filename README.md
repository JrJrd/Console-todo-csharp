# ConsoleApp-todo
This is a one-day practice project for a console application. It is a simplified version compared to the to-do list Python repo, and this time implemented in C#. 

The user is presented with a menu and can choose options by entering the corresponding numbers. The app utilizes a List&lt;string> to store the tasks.
